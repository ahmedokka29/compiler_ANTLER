This project is a compiler program developed as part of a university subject on compilers. The program takes an input file and adds block numbers after each block. It also generates a file with the block numbers and an HTML file that highlights the executed code. The program is built using IntelliJ Community Edition and ANTLR, and it is written in Java programming language. This project aims to demonstrate the knowledge and skills gained in the compilers subject and provide practical experience in developing a compiler program.

## usage:
1- Run the program.
2- Provide the input file path.
3- The program will add block numbers to the input file and write the block numbers in another file.
4- The program will generate an HTML file that highlights the executed code with a green background and the non-executed code with a red background.

## installation:
1- Install IntelliJ Community Edition.
2- Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.
