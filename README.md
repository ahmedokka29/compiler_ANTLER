[This project is a compiler program developed as part of a university subject on compilers. The program takes an input file and adds block numbers after each block. It also generates a file with the block numbers and an HTML file that highlights the executed code. The program is built using IntelliJ Community Edition and ANTLR, and it is written in Java programming language. This project aims to demonstrate the knowledge and skills gained in the compilers subject and provide practical experience in developing a compiler program.]
